A few questions beyond those I put to you in class to help inform your discussion:

How does the “beat”, the standard arrangement of the percussion for the “verse” part of the song, support the musical framework as a whole?

How do the fills support the musical structure?

How do changes to the basic pattern of the percussion support structural change in periods of transition in the pieces? 

How does the percussion change when the tempo changes?
